Test Boehm GC
=============

Boehm GC is a conservative garbage collector. This means it doesn't guarantee 
collect all non reachable memory.

This app is for understanding why this behavior seems to be random. Different runs 
of this program behaves differently.  Sometimes the memory is released and sometimes 
not.

This random behaviour is a serious problem when implementing test suite.
